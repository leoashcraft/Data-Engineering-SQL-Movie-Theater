## About The Project

Created an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for a theoretical movie theater includes detailed structures for managing customers, movies, tickets, concessions, reservations, and payments within a database. 

Based on the ERD, SQL queries were written to create the tables for the theoretical movie theater and a separate file contains the SQL queries written to insert sample data into the created tables.

Each entity is defined with primary keys for identification and relationships between entities are established through foreign keys to enable functionalities like tracking which customer made a reservation, the movies being shown, and the concessions available for purchase. 

This setup facilitates multiple reservations by a single customer, handling payments for each reservation, and allows for the inclusion of multiple tickets and concession items per reservation. 

The diagram further outlines the attributes of each entity, such as customer details, movie titles with durations, ticket specifics including seat numbers and showtimes, concession item categorization, and payment records.
